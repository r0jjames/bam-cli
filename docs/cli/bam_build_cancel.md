## bam build cancel

Stop a queued or running build

### Synopsis

Stop a queued or running build.

Bamboo stops a build by removing its unfinished jobs from the queue, so a
stage that has not started yet can still be queued afterwards. Check the
result with bam build show.

```
bam build cancel [<build>|<plan>|<target>] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --branch string   plan branch when a plan or target is given
  -h, --help            help for cancel
      --last            the last build bam triggered from this repository
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --color string    color output: auto, always or never
      --debug           log HTTP requests to stderr
      --json            print JSON
