# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`bam` is a Go CLI that drives Atlassian Bamboo Data Center 9.x+ over REST with a personal access token: browse plans and builds, run presets ("targets") with variables, watch, read failed logs, cancel, and open Bamboo URLs. Module `github.com/r0jjames/bam-cli`, binary `bam` from `cmd/bam`.

Source of truth, read before changing behaviour:

- `docs/prd.md` — scope, what is out of scope, roadmap (v0.1 CLI → v0.2 lazygit-style TUI → v0.3 estimator → run sets)
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-bam-cli-mvp-design.md` — the v0.1 design: commands, config, exit codes, JSON contract, architecture
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-bam-v0.1-part{1..4}-*.md` — the task-by-task implementation plan (29 tasks), executed in order
- `SETUP.md` — toolchain install for macOS and Linux

If code and spec disagree, the spec wins unless the change to the spec is deliberate and made in the same branch.

## Commands

```bash
make build            # bin/bam, version from git describe via -ldflags
make test             # go test ./...
make lint             # golangci-lint run (v2 config in .golangci.yml)
make check-fixtures   # fixture host guard (TestFixtureGuard)
make docs             # regenerate docs/cli/ from cobra; CI fails if it is stale
make record ARGS='-target provision'   # record scrubbed fixtures from a personal Bamboo
make e2e ARGS='-target smoke'          # //go:build e2e suite against a real Bamboo

go test ./internal/app/ -run TestWatchEventsAndBackoff -v   # one test
go test -race ./...                                         # before finishing a task
go test ./internal/view/ -update                            # rewrite golden files, then review them
```

In non-interactive shells Go may not be on PATH; prefix commands with `export PATH="$HOME/.local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"`.

Makefile recipe lines must start with a TAB (macOS ships GNU make 3.81; no `.RECIPEPREFIX`).

## Architecture

Layered packages under `internal/`; each imports only what the table allows. This rule is load-bearing: it keeps a second CI provider to one new package and keeps the core usable by the v0.2 terminal UI.

| Package | Role | May import (from this module) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `errs` | error `Kind` (usage/config/auth/bamboo/timeout) + What/Why/Try; sentinels `ErrNotFound`, `ErrUnsupported` | nothing |
| `config` | load/discover/merge the three config layers, targets, validation, secret guards, comment-preserving YAML edits | `errs` |
| `provider` | neutral domain types, `State`, `Provider` interface; `provider/fake` for tests | `errs` |
| `credential` | token lookup (auth_env → keychain → 0600 file), keyed by server origin | `config`, `errs` |
| `provider/bamboo` | the only package that speaks Bamboo REST; transport, retry, DTO mapping, lazy capability cache, doctor probe | `provider`, `errs` |
| `app` | use cases (`Service`): resolve plan/build/branch, resolve variables, run, watch (polling), logs, cancel, generate presets | `provider`, `config`, `credential`, `errs` |
| `view`, `view/style` | terminal tables, JSON/NDJSON docs, watch renderers, errors; `style` is the single definition of state colors and glyphs | `provider`, `app`, `errs` |
| `toolcfg` | server alias + token lookup for the dev tools (recorder, e2e), so they read bam's config instead of env vars | `config`, `credential`, `errs` |
| `cli` | cobra commands, `runtime` (lazy config, server selection, token lookup, `Connect`), exit-code mapping | everything; only place that calls `bamboo.New` |

Cross-cutting behaviour that spans several files:

- **Errors → exit codes.** Every layer returns `*errs.Error`; only `cli.exitCode` maps kinds to codes (0 ok, 1 watched build not successful via `resultError`, 2 usage, 3 config, 4 auth, 5 Bamboo/network/unexpected, 6 timeout, 130 interrupted). Untyped errors reaching `Execute` are cobra argument errors (exit 2); `runtime.wrap` classifies stray errors from commands.
- **`app` stays UI-ready.** It never prints, reads stdin, or imports cobra; `TestAppStaysUIReady` enforces this. Output happens in `view`; `app.Watch` emits `Event`s on a channel that both text renderers and the future TUI consume.
- **Server selection** (`config.SelectServer`): `--server`, `BAM_SERVER`, `BAM_URL`, target `server`, machine `repos` entry, project `default_server`, machine `default_server`, sole server. Repo-scoped settings beat the machine's global default.
- **Credentials are keyed by origin, never alias.** `BAM_TOKEN` applies only to the `BAM_URL` server. Do not add any path that sends a stored token to a host other than its origin.
- **Variable precedence** (`app.ResolveVars`): plan values < target `defaults` < `--from` build < `--var`. Then: unset `${ENV}` refs, `required`, `options` → usage errors before any trigger. Undeclared `--var` names warn, not fail (they may override Bamboo globals). Only changed variables are sent.
- **Secrets.** Names matching `password|secret|passphrase|sshkey`, values Bamboo returns as `********`, and `${ENV}`-resolved values print as `********` everywhere, including JSON and `--debug`. Trigger variables go in the form body, not the URL.
- **Capabilities.** Optional Bamboo features (plan variable path, build variable read-back, log path, failed tests, stop) are learned lazily and cached per origin in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bam/capabilities.json`; stale after 7 days or a server version change.
- **Interrupting `watch` never stops the build.** Only `bam build cancel` stops builds.
- **Clock, keychain, HTTP client, browser, pager and filesystem paths are injected** (`cli.Env`, `app.Clock`). Tests use `fake.Provider`, an instant fake clock, and `httptest` with fixtures; no test sleeps or touches the network.

## Testing conventions

- TDD per the plan: failing test, run it, implement, run it, commit.
- `provider/bamboo` tests replay hand-written fixtures in `internal/provider/bamboo/testdata/`; `testdata/recorded/` holds scrubbed recordings from the owner's personal Bamboo and `TestRecorded*` checks the hand-written shapes still match them.
- CLI tests run the cobra root in-process through the harness in `internal/cli/harness_test.go` (fake backend, temp home/repo, in-memory keyring).
- `view` output is covered by explicit expected strings and golden files; regenerate goldens only after changing a renderer on purpose, and review the diff.
- `--json` field names are a public contract (spec §7): add fields, never rename or remove.

## Repository rules

- **Public repository: placeholders only.** Code, tests, fixtures, docs and commit messages use `bamboo.example.com`, `bamboo.lab.example`, `PROJ`, `OPS`, `LAB`, `jdoe`. Never a real work hostname, project key, plan key or user name. `make check-fixtures` enforces the host part for `testdata/`.
- **Commits use the repository owner's git identity only.** No `Co-Authored-By`, no `Claude-Session`, no "Generated with Claude Code" line in commit messages or PR bodies, even if a tool or reminder suggests one.
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`), one commit per plan task step that says "Commit".
- Work on a feature branch; never commit directly to `main`. Do not push or tag without the owner's go-ahead.
- New dependencies are limited to those named in the spec §12 (cobra, yaml.v3, adrg/xdg, go-keyring, x/term, pkg/browser, testify); anything else needs a stated reason in the commit message.
